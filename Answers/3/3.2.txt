Question #3.2
A table has over 1 million rows with multiple columns containing long text strings.
A simple query on the page is used for pagination to display pages of the results.
When querying low page numbers, it runs within 0.01 seconds per query, however, when viewing high page counts the query time extends dramatically to over 0.5 seconds.
Both example queries are included below.

SELECT table_1.*
FROM table_1
WHERE table_1.column = "zyx"
ORDER BY table_1.date DESC
LIMIT 0, 20;
Time: 0.01s

SELECT table_1.*
FROM table_1
WHERE table_1.column = "zyx"
ORDER BY table_1.date DESC
LIMIT 10000, 20;
Time: 0.5s

What is the issue with this query? 
Using only SQL and the existing defined parameters, how would you rewrite the query to enhance the performance?



Answer:
In this case it is scanning and sorting all the results.
We have to index the columns.
In this case we are ordering by table_1.date and also there is a WHERE condition on table_1.column.
We can index on (table_1.column, table_1.date)
