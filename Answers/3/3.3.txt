Question #3.3
A simple query includes a sub-query within the SQL SELECT statement.
The sub-query returns a column value from a second table that matches the date from the first table.
This query is not running at an optimised speed, how would you rewrite the query to improve the performance.

SELECT t1.id, t1.name, t1.date AS date_filter, (SELECT t2.column_x FROM table_2 t2 WHERE t2.date = date_filter LIMIT 1) AS column_x
FROM table_1 t1
WHERE t1.category_id = 10
ORDER BY t1.date
LIMIT 10


Answer:

SELECT t1.id, t1.name, t1.date, t2.colum_x FROM table_1 as t1 INNER JOIN table_2 as t2 ON t1.date = t2.date 
WHERE 
t1.category_id = 10
ORDER BY t1.date
LIMIT 10

Also if it is indexed on (t1.category_id, t1.date) and (t2.date) it will be more eficient.
