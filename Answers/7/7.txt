No code is required for this question.

The following 6 cards are piled on top of each other:
• 3 Clubs
• 3 Spades
• 6 Diamonds
• 7 Clubs
• Queen Hearts
• King Clubs

Considering the following information, determine and EXPLAIN your workings for the order of the pack of cards. 
1. The cards are randomly shuffled.
2. The 7 Clubs is above the Queen Hearts.
3. The bottom cards value is the sum of 3 of the other cards.
4. One red card is directly on top of the other red card.
5. The 6 Diamonds is directly below either 3 Clubs or 3 Spades.
6. The Queen Hearts is above the Spade.
7. A black card is on the top of the pile.



Answer:

Assumption: the value of Queen is 12 and King is 13
Reference: https://www.setgame.com/sites/default/files/instructions/FIVE%20CROWNS%20-%20ENGLISH_0.pdf

The result is

7 Clubs
3 Clubs
6 Diamonds
Queen of Hearts
3 Spades
King clubs


Breakdown:
Now we have that 7Clubs is above Queen of hearts

The bottom card's value is the sum of 3 other cards on top.
The possiblilities are 
3+3+6= 12 Queen of hearts
3+3+7=13 King clubs

As it is given that the Queen Hearts is above Spade, we know that King clubs is the bottom card.


One red card is directly on top of another
6 Dimond and Queen of hearts
It is given that 6 Diamond is directly below 3Club or 3 Spade, and Q is above spade, it has to be

Queen Hearts
6 Diamond

From 5 and 6 we have

3 Clubs
6 Diamond
Queen of hearts
3 Spades
King Club

Also from 2 and 7, the 7 Clubs should be on top.

Thus we have the order


7 Clubs
3 Clubs
6 Diamonds
Queen of Hearts
3 Spades
King clubs
